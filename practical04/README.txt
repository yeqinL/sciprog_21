There are four files in practical04.
The task of these files is to practice using functions to finish the goal of practical03. 
I constructed the cal_rad function to calcualte the radian of the angle from 0 to 60 degrees  and created the cal_area function to calculate the tanx from upper limit to lower limit. The loop from 0 to 12 is used to calculate the area.
There is a global array to store tanx from 0 to 12
