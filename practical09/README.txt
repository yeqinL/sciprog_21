There are several files in practical09. 
mag_sq.txt records a magic matrix. non_sq.txt records a non-magic matrix. These two files are used to check the correct of the code.
magic_square.h is the header, which records a function to check whether the matrix is magic.
magic_square.c implement the main function and read the matrixs from the files mag_sq.txt and non_mag_sq.txt and check to see if they are magic.
magic_square_user.c implement the main function and read the matrix which is user input and check whether it is magic.
The time complexity is Theta(n^2).
