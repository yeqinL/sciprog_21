There are files in practical03
Both of the files calculate the area under the curve of f(x) using Trapezodial rule.
This rule describe the area between b and a can be represented in (b-a)/(2*N)(fx0+2*fx1..+2*fxn-1+fxn)
We define fx = tanx and try to calculate the area and compare with the real result log(2).
